## 🐾 Github Footprint

⚡I am passionate about sharing my knowledge with others. This is why I share most of my work on Github for others to see. My hope is that some day someone will find my work useful.

## 📈 Github Performance

⚡I do my best to keep a healthy work-life balance. Since I'm still a student, I sometimes find it hard to maintain all other aspects of my life in balance which results in a decline in Github activity. However, I do my best to keep this balance and to not disrupt the flow.

## 🏆 Github Achievements
⚡ With the free time I have, I always try to do something valuable for myself and for others. These content I upload to Github has allowed me to achieve quite a lot within a very small amount of time. These small achievements make me motivated to continue expanding my skillset and to share more and more with others on the internet. I hope I'm able to continue this all throughout my journey as an engineer.

## 🗝️ Key Languages

⚡I am interested in a variety of fields. I find myself comfortable mostly in windows programming. However, I am interested in hardware descriptions languages like Verilog as well. On the other hand, I also do low level programming such as C/C++ and Assembly. Eventhough not my strong point, I'm also capable of working with web development tools. When it comes to scripting, I'm quite confident with Python.

## 💡Highlight Projects

⚡These are some of the projects that I'm really proud of. I put a lot of effort into them since they can improve my knowledge on certain technologies. I plan to add more projects to this list and to continue developing these even further.

### 01. 💻 Eight Bit Computer Using FPGA
In this project I try to recreate the eight bit computer that [Ben Eater](https://www.youtube.com/c/BenEater) creates in his famous [youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU). However, the difference is that I intend to use FPGAs and the Verilog HDL for this task. My goal was to use this as a learning opportunity to sharpen my knowledge in FPGAs and Verilog.
- *Key Technologies* - 𓇲 Verilog | 𓇲 HDL
- *Status* - 🔄 working
- *Repository* - [eight_bit_computer](https://github.com/asankaSovis/eight_bit_computer)

### 02. 🔐 Muragala Password Manager
The goal of this project is to create a safe yet simple password manager that is easy to use. With this goal in mind, I created both a Python CLI, a C# library as well as a C# CLI application of it. I am also working on a GUI application based on the C# library. I still continue to improve this application and will add more functionalities in the future.
- *Key Technologies* - 🐍 Python | 🖥️ Visual C#
- *Status* - 🔄 working
- *Repository* - [password-manager-Python](https://github.com/asankaSovis/password-manager-Python)

### 03. 🔥 Prometheus Fire Alarm System
This project was intended to create a next-generation fire alarm system that is both robust and smart. It has the capability to successfully detect and even extinguish fires while also giving full control to the operator remotely. The command panel even has the capability to manage multiple of these fire alarm modules which gives the building much better safety when it comes to fire hazards. I have even uploaded a demonstration to [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StTqXEQ2l-Y) that shows the fire alarm system in action.
- *Key Technologies* - 💿 C++ | 🖥️ Visual C# | ♾️ Arduino
- *Status* - ✅ done
- *Repository* - [prometheus-fire-alarm](https://github.com/asankaSovis/prometheus-fire-alarm)

### 04. 📩 BitStreamer
BitStreamer is a data streaming software developed for communication engineers to send a bit stream from one COM port and check how many bits can be recieved back from another COM port. Here, the bitstream from the first COM port can be sent through a communication medium to check the efficiency of communication medium.
- *Key Technologies* - 💿 C++ | 🖥️ Visual C# | ♾️ Arduino
- *Status* - ✅ done
