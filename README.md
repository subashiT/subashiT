🤔 Knowing how to code makes you look at the world from a different perspective 🌏. That's why I'm so passionate about coding. Hello World 👋; welcome to my Github profile. I'm still a student and am 23 years of age, so there's a long journey ahead of me 🙆. I like to dream 💬 big and to see other peoples dreams come true. I'm a tech nerd 🐱‍💻 and a coding enthusiast. Hope you might find me amusing.🤩

### Highlight Projects

These are some of the projects that I'm really proud of. I put a lot of effort into them since they can improve my knowledge on certain technologies. 

#### 01. 💻 Eight Bit Computer Using FPGA
In this project I try to recreate the eight bit computer that [Ben Eater](https://www.youtube.com/c/BenEater) creates in his famous [youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU). However, the difference is that I intend to use FPGAs and the Verilog HDL for this task. My goal was to use this as a learning opportunity to sharpen my knowledge in FPGAs and Verilog.
- *Key Technologies* - 𓇲 Verilog | 𓇲 HDL
- *Status* - 🔄 working
- *Repository* - [eight_bit_computer](https://github.com/asankaSovis/eight_bit_computer)

#### 02. 🔐 Muragala Password Manager
The goal of this project is to create a safe yet simple password manager that is easy to use. With this goal in mind, I created both a Python CLI, a C# library as well as a C# CLI application of it. I am even working on a GUI application of it. I still continue to improve this application and will add more functionalities in the future.
- *Key Technologies* - 🐍 Python | 🖥️ Visual C#
- *Status* - 🔄 working
- *Repository* - [password-manager-Python](https://github.com/asankaSovis/password-manager-Python)

#### 03. 🔥 Prometheus Fire Alarm System
This project was intended to create a next-generation fire alarm system that is both robust and smart. It has the capability to successfully detect and even extinguish fires while also giving full control to the controller remotely. The command panel even has the capability to manage multiple of these fire alarm modules which gives a building much more safety when it comes to fires. I have even uploaded a demonstration to [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StTqXEQ2l-Y) that shows the fire alarm system in action.
- *Key Technologies* - 💿 C++ | 🖥️ Visual C# | ♾️ Arduino
- *Status* - ✅ done
